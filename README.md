The Word Counter is Desktop Application which I've build using the Java Programming Language during my Virtual Internship @CodeAlpha in 2023. In this application I used the Swing 
framework which is a sub-system of Java i.e., javax.swing.*; String Tokenizer class, Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for Event Handling. This application is build under Model-View-Controller
(MVC) architecture.
